Just getting things set up right now.

Todo:
 - Something is very wrong with some of our message saving; 99% sure it's the MMS saving code. Ending up with negative dates (possibly due to overflow?)
 - Switching to Google Voice was apparently a mistake. All the texts are now stored somewhere entirely different, probably private to the Gvoice App. 
 - Test the new AndroidTextManager stuff for picking up old addresses - though this may require building UI for adding new addresses.
