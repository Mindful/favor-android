Just getting things set up right now.

Todo:
 - Test the new AndroidTextManager stuff for picking up old addresses - though this may require building UI for adding new addresses.
 - Licenses in this repo as well, just like the core Favor repo
 - Activities need to know how to reload themselves on refresh, and almost every activity should reload itself on refresh.
 - Contact images might be too small the way we're getting them right now, but this should be decided after we finalize our listing UI.
 - Our results store everything as doubles right now, which eventually might be undesireable if we lose precision at high integer values
