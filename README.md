Just getting things set up right now.

Todo:
 - Finish the thread ID usage stuff; we need to store what we compute when we get addresses
 - Cursors can apparently be null with relative frequently; find all our .query calls and add null checks for the consequently produced variables
 - Code for adding even a snigle contact by name/address/whatever is likely also going to have to be aware of thread IDs in some sense
 - Switching to Google Voice was apparently a mistake. All the texts are now stored somewhere entirely different, probably private to the Gvoice App. 
 - Test the new AndroidTextManager stuff for picking up old addresses - though this may require building UI for adding new addresses.
