Serious development of the android client is on hold while we work on rewriting the backend in C++ for performance and portability reasons. Once that's complete, it's likely we'll start over from scratch (perhaps preserving the git history for the sake of posterity, or something)


Libraries we like:

[Action Bar Sherlock](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock)

[Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js)
